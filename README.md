# Summer 2020 Internships - Engineering Pre-assignment - Front End Solution by Alice Fritz

## How to run

Run index.html on localhost

*or*

Visit https://alicefritz.github.io/summer2020/

*opening index.html directly in a browser will make the fetch-request fail because it expects a valid URL.*

### React version
After finishing this (and applying) I decided to give React a try by attempting to 'clone' the solution I made with HTML/CSS/JS.

The result can be found here:
